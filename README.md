#  Java Course

This is a compilation of all the java programs I've tried and tested during a course by [NPTEL](https://swayam.gov.in/explorer?ncCode=NPTEL) (Programming in Java).

## All algorithms are implemented in Java

These implementations are for learning purposes (or educational purposes). The implementations may be less efficient than the Java standard library.
You can use this [site](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial) for knowing every content briefly.
